## Installing
I've tested this on Ubuntu and Windows 10 using Python 3.6/3.7 with no problems. So assuming that you already have Python and Pip 
installed checkout the source code from here:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/RatJuggler/ouroboros.git
$ cd ouroboros
```
Then install/update using:
```
$ pip3 install -U .
```
## Running
```
$ ouroboros --help
